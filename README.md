# Automobile-Parts-Classifier
## Inspiration
The theme of Hack-ccelerate helped us discover this exciting project. We wished to explore Computer vision based projects, and hence we chose to create an automobile parts classifier using CNN.

## What it does
Our deep learning model classifies 14 different types of automobile parts.

## How we built it
The model was built mainly using the tensorflow keras API.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we faced was handling the data in such a way as to prevent overfitting. This was overcome using data augmentation and a proper CNN architecture, that was created with thorough experimentation. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to achieve a good accuracy, without using any kinda of transfer learning. Our custom model was able to compete with already established tensorflow architectures.

## What we learned
Working on creating a custom CNN architecture helped us in creating a strong intuition about how different architectures perform, how different layers affect training, etc.

## What's next for Automobile Parts Classifier
The next goal is to improve the generalisation of the model.
